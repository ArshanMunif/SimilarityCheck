## SimilarityCheck

With this app, you will run a simple UI, powered by gradio, that will allow you to enter two bodies of text and return a similarity score. The similarity comparison is done by analysing the semantic meaning and not just pure keywords. 

A huggingface sentence transformer model was utilised in this app: it maps sentences & paragraphs to a 768 dimensional dense vector space and can be used for tasks like clustering or semantic search.
